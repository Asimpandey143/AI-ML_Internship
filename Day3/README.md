# ðŸ“ˆ Day 3: Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This is my **Day 3 task** for the **AI/ML Internship Program**.  
In this project, I implemented **simple** and **multiple linear regression** models on a **Housing Price Prediction** dataset. I also created both static and interactive visualizations using Python libraries to analyze model performance and feature relationships.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did

- **Loaded the dataset** using `Pandas`.
- **Encoded categorical variables** (e.g., `mainroad`, `furnishingstatus`) using `LabelEncoder`.

### ðŸ”¹ Performed Linear Regression
- Built a **simple linear regression** model using `area` as the sole feature.
- Built a **multiple linear regression** model using all available features.

### ðŸ”¹ Evaluated Models
- Calculated:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **RÂ² Score**
- Exported evaluation metrics and coefficients to `model_results.txt`.

### ðŸ”¹ Created Visualizations
- **Correlation heatmap** showing feature relationships.
- **Scatter plot with regression line** (Area vs. Price) for simple linear regression.
- **Bar chart** of feature importance for multiple regression.
- **Actual vs. Predicted** price plot to assess model performance.
- Combined all plots into a single image: `housing_price_analysis.png`.

### ðŸ”¹ Created Interactive Visualizations (Using Plotly)
- Interactive **2D Scatter Plot**: Area vs. Price â†’ `scatter_plot.html`
- Interactive **3D Scatter Plot**: Area, Bedrooms vs. Price â†’ `3d_scatter_plot.html`
